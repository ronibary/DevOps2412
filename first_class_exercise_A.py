first = 7
second = 44.3
print(f"{first} + {second} = " + str(first+second))
print(f"{first} * {second} = " + str(first*second))
print(f"{first} * {second} = " + str(second/first))

part B
-----------

at the end the following values will be :

a = 9
b = 8
c = 15


part C
---------

there is no difference it's 2 ways to define string into variable -> name

The issue with the following code :

my_number = 5+5
print("result is: " + my_number)

The issue is you try to concat string with number this will produce error .

the suggestion is to convert the number to string using -> str
print("result is: " + str(my_number))


part D:

result of print : 7


Challange:

a = 8
b = "123"

print(a + int(b))
